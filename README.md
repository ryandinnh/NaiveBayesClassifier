# NaiveBayesClassifier
A Naive Bayes Classifier to get a probabilistic diagnosis of a subset of data containing hippocampal volume. This repository includes code that models a 2D Scatterplot, calculation of mean and variance data, and calculation of the Naive Bayes Classifier accuracy. The test and train data set of hippocampal volume are from: http://www.oasis-brains.org. 

OASIS-hippocampus.csv is the data set containing both the test and train set of hippocampus volume. The data consists of the hippocampal volume, derived from MRI, for elderly subjects, including healthy control subjects and those with mild to moderate dementia.

scatterplot_NBC.py is the hippocampal volume training data set as a 2D scatterplot (right and left hippocampal volume as the two axes). Healthy brains and Dementia positive brains are represented as differennt colors. Heathy brains are green and Dementia positive brains are red on the scatterplot.
